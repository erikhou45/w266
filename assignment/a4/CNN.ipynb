    "CNNs are a more sophisticated neural model for sentence classification than the Neural BOW model we saw in the last section. CNNs operate by sweeping a collection of filters over a text. Each filter produces a sequence of feature values known as a _feature map_. In one of the most basic formulations introduced by [Kim (2014)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181), a single layer of _pooling_ is used to summarize the _feature maps_ as a fixed length vector. The fixed length vector is then feed to the output layer in order to produce classification labels. A popular choice for the pooling operation is to take the maximum feature value from by each _feature map_.\n",
